# Optical-Frequency-Comb-OFC-Lugiato-Lefever-simulation
This code is made to simulate the evolution of an Optical Frequency Comb (OFC) using the Lugiato Lefever equation (LLE) solved by the Split-Step Fourier Method (SSFM) in a microring resonator (MRR). It uses pump light detuning from the MRR resonance wavelength to make a sweep variable sweep in normalized coordinates
